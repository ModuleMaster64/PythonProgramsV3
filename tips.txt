## Some helpful tips for python!

Use any() and all() to simplify complex condition checks across lists.
Use set() to remove duplicates from a list quickly.
Use sorted() with key= to sort custom objects or dictionaries.
Use try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully and avoid crashes.
Use f-strings for cleaner and faster string formatting: f"Hello, {name}!"
Use type() and isinstance() to check variable types safely.
Use map() and filter() for functional-style data transformations.
Use *args and **kwargs to write flexible functions that accept any number of arguments.
Use timeit module to benchmark performance of small code snippets.
Use __name__ == "__main__" to make your scripts both importable and executable.
Use os.path and pathlib for cross-platform file path handling.
Use collections.Counter to count elements in a list efficiently.
Use itertools for advanced looping patterns like combinations and permutations.
Use enumerate() when you need both index and value in a loop.
Use zip() to pair elements from multiple lists.
Use defaultdict to avoid key errors when building dictionaries.
Use contextlib.suppress() to ignore specific exceptions cleanly.
Use dataclasses to create lightweight classes with less boilerplate.
Use re (regular expressions) for powerful pattern matching in strings.
Use logging instead of print() for better debugging and production diagnostics.
